# AI-Body-Language-Detector
A deep learning project on the topic of computer vision
This is one of my computer vision projects on python. Unfortunetly, I couldn't share the csv datasheet of the training data, because it is heavier than 25MB. The interest of this project is that I developed a virtual environment of body language decoder and used advanced deep learning libraries like Tensorflow/keras, scikit-learn, MediaPipe and OpenCV. 
This is a great project if you want to work on computer vision and overall work on machine learning modeling. You will find also a lot of helpful notes looking on my jupyter sheets.
